## About Me:

I graduated from the Belarusian State Technological University in 2002. Since then till the present day I have been working in designing furniture and various wood products area as the process engineer. 
I've never been working in the IT field. When I was a teen I was keen on programming, I was dreemed to become a developer. Later I was learning programming languages while I was studying in the university. I've found out about RS School and the "JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0" course from my wife who is EPAM employee, so I decided to take a part. 
My strenths are: I'm reliable, quick-learner, curious (I'm keen on learning new things and getting new skills), attentive to details, polite, a team-player, able to work independently.
